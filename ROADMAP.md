# Plotting — Roadmap

A macOS SwiftUI app for analyst review of clinical findings produced upstream
by a cluster of analysis machines (VF/VT onset, AFib, PVCs, disease vectors).
The PhysioNet WFDB record (`.hea` + `.dat`) is the *context* the analyst
needs to interpret each finding; the findings themselves are the primary
data surface.

## Current state (updated 2026-06-18)

**Analyst disposition workflow**
- `AnnotationDisposition` + `DispositionFile` schema-versioned sidecar at
  `<bundle>/dispositions.json`. Three logical states — `unreviewed`
  (implicit by absence), `confirmed` (with optional VT/VF sub-kind), and
  `dismissed`. Re-running the producer never overwrites analyst work.
- `DispositionStore` is the `@Observable` source of truth: reads the
  sidecar at recording load, writes on every `confirm` / `dismiss` /
  `reset`. Mutations require the toolbar's `Editing` latch (same lock
  semantics as notes editing).
- `FindingsPanel` rows show inline confirm/dismiss/reset controls when
  unlocked; row chrome reflects state (green border + ✓ for confirmed,
  strikethrough + ✗ for dismissed). The panel header shows a compact
  `confirmed · dismissed · unreviewed` tally.
- `FindingsSummaryHeader` total chip carries the same tally so analyst
  progress is visible even when the inspector is hidden.
- `FindingDensityTimeline` lanes dim dismissed events to ~30% and
  outline confirmed events with a green ring, so triage state is
  scannable at the full-recording level.

**Quality shading**
- `QualityStrip` — one heat band per quality / artifact-ratio channel
  (the Medallion `ecg_artifact_ratio` is the canonical case). Each
  1-min cell renders as gray with opacity proportional to the ratio;
  cells over the configurable threshold (default 0.1, per Medallion's
  suggested floor) gain a thin orange outline for quick scan.
- Routed via `LowRatePartition` by name pattern (`_ratio` suffix or
  `artifact_ratio` substring), so future quality channels (PPG, etc.)
  surface without code changes.

**Alarm & ventilation state strips**
- `BooleanChannelScanner` — pure utility that turns a boolean-ish trend
  channel (alarm flag, status indicator) into `[ClosedRange<Int64>]`
  active spans. NaN is inactive; threshold is configurable.
- `AlarmStrip` — one thin lane per alarm channel (`had_high_priority_alarm`,
  `had_suction_alarm`, `nebulizer_status`, `had_alarm_silenced`, …)
  spanning the full recording. Active runs render as colored bars at the
  appropriate fractional position; tapping any bar jumps the viewport.
- `StateBackdropStrip` — one-row colored band driven by the Medallion GMM
  state probability pair (`prob_state_spontaneous` +
  `prob_state_assist_control`). Each 1-min cell colored by the dominant
  state with opacity tracking certainty. Tap to jump.
- `BedsideView.LowRatePartition` routes low-rate channels by name into
  vitals (sparkline trend strip), alarms (alarm strip), and the state
  pair (backdrop strip). Each strip renders only when its inputs exist —
  plain ECG records show none of the new chrome.

**Multi-frequency WFDB + low-rate trends**
- `WFDBHeaderParser` honors the per-signal `format[xspf]` suffix, so a
  record can mix 250 Hz ECG signals (`16x250`) with 1 Hz feature signals
  (`16x1`) at one base frame rate. `WFDBHeader.sampleRate(for:)` /
  `sampleCount(for:)` expose per-signal values.
- `WFDBSampleDecoder` groups signals by `.dat` filename and opens each
  file exactly once. Each file may hold one signal (per-signal files —
  the path the Medallion feature store will use) or several at the same
  rate (legacy single-file records).
- `Channel.isTrendChannel` (`sampleRate < 5 Hz`) lets `BedsideView`
  partition channels: ECG goes on the Metal canvas, low-rate trends go
  to `ChannelTrendStrip` — stacked Swift Charts sparklines below the
  canvas, time-locked to the shared `RecordingViewport`. The strip is
  hidden entirely when the recording has no trend channels.
- `SyntheticRecording.makeMultiFrequencyRecord(into:)` builds a per-
  signal-file fixture (8 ECG + fake HR + fake SpO₂) so the welcome
  screen demo exercises the new path.

**Triage surfaces**
- `AnnotationSummary` — pure aggregation over `[Annotation]` that rolls
  each category up into counts, severity breakdowns, and total range
  extent. Sorted critical-first, then by count.
- `FindingsSummaryHeader` — compact horizontal chip row above the
  canvas: `PVC 47 (12 critical) · AFib 38s · VT 3`. Click a chip to
  toggle the shared `FindingFilter` for that category.
- `FindingDensityTimeline` — one thin lane per surviving category
  spanning the full recording. Points render as ticks, ranges as bars.
  Tap anywhere on a lane to jump the viewport. Lets the analyst see
  finding clusters across a multi-hour record at a glance.

**Welcome screen**
- `WelcomeView` is the first-launch experience: a centered card on a
  faint ECG-paper backdrop with the app name, a one-line tagline, three
  feature bullets, and primary / secondary actions.
- **Open Record Folder** opens the file picker (same as the toolbar
  action). **Try a sample recording** synthesizes a small 8-lead WFDB
  fixture on demand via `SyntheticRecording.makeFixture()` so a
  first-launch user has an instant on-ramp.
- **Recent folders** — `RecentFoldersStore` persists up to ten
  security-scoped bookmarks to `UserDefaults` and exposes them as
  clickable rows under the card; remove (✕) drops a single entry.
- **Drop a folder** anywhere on the welcome view to open it (or any
  file in a record folder — the welcome view promotes a file drop to
  its enclosing folder).

**Bedside layout**
- `LeadChipBar` across the top of `BedsideView` with a per-lead color chip
  and a Focus / Strips segmented control. Focus mode shows a single tall
  panel for the selected lead; Strips mode stacks every lead vertically.
- `RecordContextPanel` — top-of-view summary block that surfaces `.hea`
  header comments (recovered from the original WFDB file) and a Markdown
  `notes.md` editor that lives next to the recording bundle.
- Read/write latch toolbar toggle (lock / lock.open) gates notes editing
  and is wired to gate future annotation create/edit/delete affordances.
- Window adaptability: narrower sidebar (160 pt min), narrower inspector
  (220 pt min), wrapped summary text, and a reduced canvas minimum so the
  app collapses cleanly to a small window.

**Annotation model (the wow factor)**
- `Annotation` — `kind` (point/range), `category`, optional `label`,
  `confidence`, `severity` (info/notice/warning/critical, Comparable),
  `source`, optional `note`, `lead`, `evidenceContextSeconds`.
- `AnnotationFile` JSON wire format (`schemaVersion: 1`) is the canonical
  ingest path. Timestamps accept either `startSample`/`endSample` (already
  aligned) or `startUnixMS`/`endUnixMS` (viewer resolves at import).
- WFDB `.atr` is a legacy adapter — beat letters become point annotations
  tagged `source = "wfdb.atr"`.
- Importer scans `<recordName>.annotations.json` first, then `.atr`/`.qrs`,
  concatenating both.
- `Recording` decode is back-compat: legacy manifests with
  `[WFDBAnnotation]` arrays still load and get adapted on the fly.

**Findings UI**
- Right-side `inspector` drawer (`FindingsPanel`) with filter chip bar:
  categories (each with its palette color dot), severities, sources, and
  a confidence-threshold slider.
- Findings list — color-grouped rows with time, severity badge, confidence,
  source, and note preview. Click to jump the viewport; range findings
  widen the viewport to show context around them.
- The filter is shared with the canvas — filtered-out findings stop
  rendering everywhere.
- `CategoryPalette` — hand-tuned colors for common clinical categories
  (reds = ventricular, purples = atrial, blues = conduction, slate =
  noise), with deterministic FNV-1a → HSV fallback for unknown categories.

**Waveform Canvas — Metal**
- `MTKView` via `NSViewRepresentable`. Per-frame: clear paper → range fills
  (one bucket per category) → grid minor → grid major → grid landmark →
  trace OR pyramid envelope → point rules (one bucket per category).
- Shaders: `traceVertex`, `lineVertex`, `envelopeVertex`, `rangeVertex`,
  `colorFragment`. Trace is now a triangle-strip polyline — each sample
  extrudes to a 2-vertex ribbon and the vertex shader computes the
  perpendicular in screen-pixel space, so line width stays constant in
  points regardless of zoom (Metal has no `glLineWidth` equivalent).
- Annotation buckets group by `(category, kind)` so each category gets its
  own color in a single instanced draw call. Severity modulates alpha.
- SwiftUI overlays for axis tick labels (time + mV), annotation symbol
  text, and an off-scale chevron overlay driven by `ClippedRangeScanner`
  (▲/▼ markers at the canvas edge where the signal clipped above/below).
- Overview ribbon stays Swift Charts — tiny widget, click/drag scrub.

**Data engine**
- `BinaryRecordingFile` v2 — 64-byte header + packed Float32 body.
- `MappedSampleAccess` + `PyramidLevelFile` — mmap-backed reads.
- `PyramidBuilder` — single-pass cascading min/max bins (stride 10, up to
  6 levels).
- `ChannelView` — LOD-aware reader; `selectLevel(samplesPerPixel:)` returns
  raw or the deepest fitting pyramid level.
- `RecordingViewport` (`@Observable @MainActor`) — shared time window for
  every lead, with `pan` / `setStart` / `setWidth` / `jump` clamped to
  bounds and a 100 ms minimum window.

**Ingest + sandbox**
- File picker selects a *folder*; security scope covers all files inside.
- `WFDBHeaderParser` supports format 16 and 212 (MIT-BIH style); baseline
  defaults to `adcZero` per WFDB spec.
- `RecordingStore` async import on background task; per-record import cache
  in `ContentView` so switching records is instant after first import.

**ECG paper grid**
- `ECGGridSpec.forDuration(seconds:)` picks adaptive minor / major /
  landmark spacings per zoom level so the grid stays readable from 1 s to
  multi-hour windows. Landmark is always 5× the major — the "1 s / 2.5 mV"
  reference line on standard ECG paper.

**Ingest extras**
- `WFDBHeaderParser` preserves `#`-prefixed comment lines verbatim and
  threads them through the importer onto `Recording.headerComments`.
- `WFDBImporter` copies any sibling `notes.md` from the source folder into
  the imported bundle and records its filename on the manifest so the
  context panel can read/write it.

**Tests** — 135 total (131 unit + 4 UI).

## Architecture

Three layers as agreed; all three now built:

1. **Data Engine** — mmap + pyramid + LOD selector + viewport.
2. **Waveform Canvas** — Metal (MTKView) rendering paper, grid, trace,
   envelope, point + range annotations.
3. **Control Overlay** — SwiftUI for axes, annotation symbols, gestures,
   findings panel, filter chips, toolbar.

## Next goals

### Near-term (next session)
- [ ] "Attach findings…" toolbar action — pick a JSON from anywhere and
      merge into the current recording's annotations (currently ingest is
      folder-scan only)
- [ ] Persist annotations separately from `recording.json` as
      `annotations.json` so re-running the analysis cluster doesn't require
      re-importing the .dat samples
- [ ] Schema versioning — write a deliverable `schema.md` in the repo so
      cluster producers have a stable contract
- [ ] Mini-timeline ticks under each channel overview ribbon — colored
      dots at every annotation's fractional position so beat density and
      finding clusters are visible at full-recording scale
- [ ] Hover tooltips on the canvas — hit-test for the nearest finding and
      show its full note + confidence + source

### Medium-term
- [ ] Lead-specific findings — render annotations only on the channels
      that match their `lead` field
- [ ] Finding sorting modes (by time, by category, by confidence, by
      severity) in the findings panel
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: J/K through findings, →/← pan one window,
      +/− zoom
- [ ] Per-channel y-axis autoscale (instead of fixed ±5 mV) when the
      signal sits in a narrower band
- [ ] Beat clustering at low zoom — collapse adjacent points of the same
      category into a single hit-counter mark when they overlap
- [ ] Snapshot export — current viewport as PNG with grid + findings, for
      sharing with clinicians

### Deferred
- [ ] Multi-file WFDB records (per-signal `.dat`)
- [ ] Additional WFDB sample formats (8, 16+, 24, 32, 310, 311, 80)
- [ ] Annotation authoring inside the app (manual marker placement)
- [ ] Export imported recordings to a portable bundle
- [ ] HDR/wide-color-gamut Metal canvas
- [ ] Two-finger trackpad swipe → pan via an NSScrollView bridge
